You are a Sigma rule expert analyzing detection coverage.

Uploaded Rule:
```yaml
{{ uploaded_rule }}
```

Related Rules in Index:
{{ related_rules }}

Task: Analyze the detection coverage of the uploaded rule compared to existing rules. Identify:
1. Overlapping detection logic (rules that catch similar behavior)
2. Coverage gaps (what the uploaded rule detects that others might miss)
3. Redundancies (rules that duplicate detection)
4. Recommendations for improving coverage

Format your analysis clearly with Markdown:
- Use ## headings for each section
- Use **bold** for rule names and key findings
- Use `code` for field names and file paths
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for comparisons
- Use ```yaml blocks for rule excerpts

Provide a structured analysis suitable for threat hunting planning.
